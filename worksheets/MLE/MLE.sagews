<div class="introduction" id="introduction-3"><p id="p-7">A nuclear reactor sits at the bottom of a pool with volume 75000 L. The water in the pool is not processed or filtered, so algae naturally grow in it (far enough from the reactor unit, anyway). Operators must keep this growth within reasonable and safe limits, or facility operations will be adversely affected.</p></div>

<p id="p-8">Suppose that, in the absence of other factors, algae reproduce in the pool at such a rate that their mass doubles every 7.7 d.</p>
<p id="p-9">Formulate and solve an initial value problem that will give you the growth constant \(r\text{.}\) This growth constant depends only on the algae's reproductive characteristics and the conditions in the ambient environment (which, given the proximity of the reactor, are not uniformly friendly). Make the usual assumption: that the change in population is directly proportional to the current population.</p>

<p id="p-11">Reactor operators use a combination of filtering and poison techniques to remove algae at a constant rate (so that the same mass of algae is removed each day). Suppose that a new regulation is going into effect right now (at \(t = 0\)) that requires zero algae measured 20 d from this moment. If the mass of algae that can be removed from the pool is 400 <sup>g</sup>⁄<sub>h</sub>, find the greatest mass of algae that can be present at \(t = 0\) such that the facility will still be in compliance when the regulation takes effect. You will need to formulate and solve an appropriate initial value problem using the growth constant you found above. Pay attention to the setup and resist the urge to jump right to the equation for the algae mass.</p></article></article></div>
