Suppose that a new regulation is going into effect right now (at $t = 0$) that requires zero algae measured 20 d from this moment. If the mass of algae that can be removed from the pool is 400 <sup>g</sup>⁄<sub>h</sub>, find the greatest mass of algae that can be present at $t = 0$ such that the facility will still be in compliance when the regulation takes effect. You will need to formulate and solve an appropriate initial value problem using the growth constant you found above. Pay attention to the setup and resist the urge to jump right to the equation for the algae mass.</p></article></article></div>"]}
